# ASCEngine
Game engine for ASCII games that run in the terminal like in the good old days

## Installation

Start by either extracting the zip file, or cloning the repo to install the updates easily by using this command :

    git clone git@github.com:GiovanniKarra/ASCEngine.git

When you want to update your version, use : 

    git pull

Run `setup_packages.py` to setup the ascengine package, and to install [dependencies](#dependencies).

There you go, that's all it takes !

### Dependencies

The code depends on these python packages : pynput, consoledraw

You can install them by using :

    pip install <package_name>

Or by running `setup_packages.py`

## Creating a project

In the engine's installation folder, you'll find a `new_project.py` file, run it in order to create a `projects` folder with a project template.

The template includes a `main.py` file, containing the main logic that you need, it's the file that runs your game.
