# ASCEngine
Game engine for ASCII games that run in the terminal like in the good old days

## Installation

Start by either extracting the zip file, or cloning the repo to install the updates easily by using this command :

> git clone git@github.com:GiovanniKarra/ASCEngine.git

When you want to update your version, use : 

> git pull

There you go, that's all it takes !


## Creating a project

In the engine's installation folder, you'll find a `new_project.py` file, run it in order to create a `projects` folder with a project template.

The template includes a `main.py` file, containing the main logic that you need, it's the file that runs your game.


## Feedback

The project is far from being complete. You can post any problem you encounter or any suggestion as an issue here on github

### Enjoy !
